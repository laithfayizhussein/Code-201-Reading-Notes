## Code Debugging
### Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors.

### Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose.

### Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors.

### Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.

## JavaScript Debuggers
### Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.

### Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.

### With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing.



 # the short meaning of  debugger
After console.log, debugger is my favorite quick and dirty debugging tool. If you place a debugger; line in your code, Chrome will automatically stop there when executing. You can even wrap it in conditionals, so it only runs when you need it.
