## how add style in the html page.

1. internal   by this code style and this carly {}
2. external  its independent page uesing tage to style what u need 
3. in line  by writing style after the element

## why the best way to ues style by external way.
- external this is the correct method to use ..
why ... cause after builed a big web site its will be hard to see every style code to change the color and the most html as document if u wanna change some thing u need to change the style page not the html ..

## why its wrong to write inline code ... 
*** cause when the web site read the code the inline code take advaneg more than the any thing else ***
examle if u color the p in the style external by red and in the inline u color it blue .. it will take the blue one and if u will make style for every elemnt alone it will take too much time .


## JavaScript:

what is a script and how do I create one?
A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, 
so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.

## how use the js in the web

It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extension.
The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the element can be used to load a CSS file).
If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
