# links

## Syntax Explanation:

- href : The href attribute is used to specify 
the destination address of the link used.
- Text link : The text link 
is the visible part of the link.

## example 
' <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google Search</a>
<a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/">Tutorial Republic</a>
<a href="images/kites.jpg">
    <img src="kites-thumb.jpg" alt="kites">
</a> '


## Setting the Targets for Links
 
### The target attribute tells the browser where to open the linked document. There are four defined targets, and each target name starts with an underscore(_) character:

- _blank — Opens the linked document in a new window or tab.
- _parent — Opens the linked document in the parent window.
- _self — Opens the linked document in the same window or tab as the source document. This is the default, hence it is not necessary to explicitly specify this value.
- _top — Opens the linked document in the full browser window.


# Introduction to CSS layout
## This article will recap some of the CSS layout features we've already touched upon in previous modules — such as different display (en-US) values — and introduce some of the concepts we'll be covering throughout this module.

- Normal Flow
### Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that. This article explains the basics of normal flow as a grounding for learning how to change it.

## Flexbox
### Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals.

- Grids
### CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many feature that make building complex layouts straightforward. This article will give you all you need to know to get started with page layout.

- Floats

### Originally for floating images inside blocks of text, the float (en-US) property became one of the most commonly used tools for creating multiple column layouts on webpages. With the advent of Flexbox and Grid it has now returned to its original purpose, as this article explains.

- Positioning
### Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave differently, for example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport. This article explains the different position (en-US) values, and how to use them.

# Function Definition
### Before we use a function, we need to define it. The most common way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.

## Syntax
### The basic syntax is shown here.

' <script type = "text/javascript">
   <!--
      function functionname(parameter-list) {
         statements
      }
   //-->
</script> '
