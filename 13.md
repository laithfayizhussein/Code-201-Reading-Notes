# What is localStorage in JavaScript?


### localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed.

### For a visual refresher on how to use localStorage in JavaScript, check out the video tutorial below:

# Where is localStorage stored?
### In Google Chrome, web storage data is saved in an SQLite file in a subfolder in the user’s profile. The subfolder is located at \AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Local Storage on Windows machines and ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local Storage on macOS

### Firefox saves storage objects in an SQLite file called webappsstore.sqlite, which is also located in the user’s profile folder.


# What is Window.localStorage?

### The localStorage mechanism is available via the Window.localStorage property. Window.localStorage is part of the Window interface in JavaScript, which represents a window containing a DOM document.

### The Window interface features a wide range of functions, constructors, objects, and namespaces. Window.localStorage is a read-only property that returns a reference to the local storage object used to store data that is only accessible to the origin that created it.

# How does localStorage work?

### To use localStorage in your web applications, there are five methods to choose from:

1. setItem(): Add key and value to localStorage
2. getItem(): This is how you get items from localStorage
3. removeItem(): Remove an item by key from localStorage
4. clear(): Clear all localStorage
5. key(): Passed a number to retrieve the key of a localStorage


### example for localstorage

`JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem('user'));`
